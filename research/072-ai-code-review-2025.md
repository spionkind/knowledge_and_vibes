### Production Scale

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Daily reviews | 24,000+ |
| Users served | 12,000+ |
| Code changes requested | 400K+ |
| Adoption rate | Growing |

### Outdated Rate Metric

Novel metric to track adoption:

```
Outdated Rate = Comments marked outdated by code changes
             / Total comments generated

Lower = developers accept more suggestions
Higher = suggestions ignored or wrong
```

## What Makes AI Review Effective

### From GitHub Actions Study

Analysis of 22,000+ review comments across 178 repositories:

| Factor | Impact on Code Changes |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Concise comments** | Higher adoption |
| **Contains code snippets** | Higher adoption |
| **Manually triggered** | Higher adoption |
| **Auto-triggered on all PRs** | Lower adoption |
| **Vague suggestions** | Often ignored |

### Comment Format Best Practices

```markdown
## Effective AI Review Comment

### Issue
Potential SQL injection on line 42.

### Suggested Fix
```python
# Before (vulnerable)
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# After (safe)
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

### Why This Matters
User input is directly interpolated into SQL query,
enabling attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
```

### Ineffective Comment
```markdown
Consider improving the code quality in the database access section.
```

## Speed vs Quality Tradeoffs

### Review Time Comparison

| Review Type | Time to First Feedback | Quality |
|-------------|----------------------|---------|
| Human only | 4-24 hours | High |
| AI only | 30 seconds | Variable |
| AI + Human | 30 seconds initial + human validation | High |

### Recommended Workflow

```

## What AI Review Catches

### Strong Detection Areas

| Category | AI Detection Rate |
|----------|------------------|
| Security vulnerabilities | 95% improvement |
| Null pointer issues | High |
| Resource leaks | High |
| Style violations | Very High |
| API misuse | High |

### Weak Detection Areas

| Category | Why AI Struggles |
|----------|-----------------|
| Business logic errors | Lacks domain context |
| Architecture violations | Needs system-level view |
| Performance at scale | Can't profile |
| Subtle race conditions | Requires deep reasoning |

## Practical Implications

### For Knowledge & Vibes

AI code review complements our security gates:

| Stage | Human | AI |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Pre-commit | TDD | `ubs --staged` |
| PR review | Architecture, logic | Security, bugs, style |
| Calibration | Requirements alignment | Automated checks |

### Integration Pattern

```markdown
## Bead Close Checklist

- [x] Tests pass
- [x] `ubs --staged` clean
- [x] AI review issues addressed
- [x] Human review (if required for complexity)
- [x] Commit
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI review is mainstream** — 14.9% of PRs in late 2025
2. **Two-stage works best** — Detection + verification
3. **Comment format matters** — Code snippets > vague suggestions
4. **Manual trigger > auto** — Targeted reviews more effective
5. **AI + Human hybrid** — Best of both worlds
6. **Track adoption** — Outdated Rate shows real impact
