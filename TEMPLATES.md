## Operator-Facing Templates

These are filled out during planning, before implementation begins.

---

### North Star Card

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Purpose** | Anchor the entire project. Everything traces back to this. |
| **Use when** | Starting any project, no matter the size. |
| **Template** | [`templates/NORTH_STAR_CARD_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/NORTH_STAR_CARD_TEMPLATE.md) |
| **Destination** | `PLAN/00_north_star.md` |

**Contains:**
- Goal (what success looks like)
- Success metrics (how you'll measure it)
- Rigor tier (how much process this project needs)
- Non-goals (what you're explicitly NOT building)
- Stop/ask rules (when the AI should pause for human input)

---

### Requirements (REQ/AC)

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Purpose** | Define what must be true in testable terms. |
| **Use when** | After North Star is set, before any implementation. |
| **Template** | [`templates/REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md) |
| **Destination** | `PLAN/01_requirements.md` |

**Contains:**
- `REQ-*`: Observable outcomes or constraints
- `AC-*`: Acceptance criteria (test-shaped)
- Priority (P0 = must have, P1 = should have, P2 = nice to have)

> **Key rule:** If you can't test it, it's not a requirement. It's a wish.

---

### Requirements QA

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Purpose** | Eliminate ambiguity before it becomes expensive rework. |
| **Use when** | After drafting requirements, before finalizing. |
| **Template** | [`templates/REQUIREMENTS_QA_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/REQUIREMENTS_QA_TEMPLATE.md) |
| **Destination** | `PLAN/01_requirements_qa.md` |

**Contains:**
- Ambiguous requirements flagged
- Suggested rewrites
- Missing constraints identified
- Inconsistencies resolved

---

### Decisions (ADRs)

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Purpose** | Record significant decisions so they're not relitigated. |
| **Use when** | Any decision that affects architecture, technology, or approach. |
| **Template** | [`templates/DECISIONS_ADRS_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/DECISIONS_ADRS_TEMPLATE.md) |
| **Destination** | `PLAN/02_decisions_adrs.md` |

**Contains:**
- Decision title
- Options considered (A, B, C)
- Tradeoffs for each
- Decision made and rationale
- Reversal triggers (what would change our mind)

---

### Risks & Spikes

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Purpose** | Identify unknowns and convert them into timeboxed investigations. |
| **Use when** | Before committing to a major approach. |
| **Template** | [`templates/RISKS_AND_SPIKES_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/RISKS_AND_SPIKES_TEMPLATE.md) |
| **Destination** | `PLAN/06_risks_and_spikes.md` |

**Contains:**
- Top risks/unknowns
- Spike tasks (evidence-producing investigations)
- Expected decision impact (which ADR does this unlock?)

---

### Traceability

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Purpose** | Maintain coverage from requirements through implementation. |
| **Use when** | Throughout implementation, updated as work completes. |
| **Template** | [`templates/TRACEABILITY_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/TRACEABILITY_TEMPLATE.md) |
| **Destination** | `PLAN/traceability.md` |

**Contains:**
- North Star reference
- REQ → Beads mapping
- AC → Tests mapping
- Coverage gaps

*Note: This is agent-maintained. The operator shouldn't need to update it manually.*

---

### CODEMAPS

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Purpose** | Orientation documents that help agents understand a codebase. |
| **Use when** | Working in an existing or complex codebase. |
| **Template** | [`templates/CODEMAPS_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/CODEMAPS_TEMPLATE.md) |
| **Destination** | `CODEMAPS/<area>.md` |

**Contains:**
- Area overview
- Key files and their purposes
- Conventions and patterns
- Dependencies and relationships

---

### AGENTS.md

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Purpose** | Project-specific instructions for AI agents. |
| **Use when** | Any project where agents will work. |
| **Template** | [`templates/AGENTS_TEMPLATE.md`](./templates/AGENTS_TEMPLATE.md) |
| **Destination** | `AGENTS.md` (project root) |

**Contains:**
- Project context
- Coding conventions
- Safety rules
- Known gotchas

## Using Templates in Your Project

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### Option 1: Copy What You Need
