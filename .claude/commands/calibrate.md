# /calibrate

Run the `calibrate` skill for an evidence-seeking roundtable.

**Scope:** $ARGUMENTS

Execute the full protocol from `.claude/skills/calibrate/SKILL.md`:
1. Pre-work: Re-read North Star, audit beads, prepare challenges
2. Broadcast: Send analysis to all agents via Agent Mail
3. Challenge: Evidence-backed challenges and responses
4. Synthesize: Falsifiable decisions, preserve dissent
5. User Report: Present findings objectively (user decides)
6. Verify: Cross-verify before resuming work

**Philosophy:** No compromise on truth. Evidence over rhetoric.
