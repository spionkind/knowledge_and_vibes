## Memory System: cass-memory

Before starting complex tasks, retrieve relevant context:

```bash
cm context "<task description>" --json
```

This returns:
- **relevantBullets**: Rules that may help with your task
- **antiPatterns**: Pitfalls to avoid
- **historySnippets**: Past sessions that solved similar problems
- **suggestedCassQueries**: Searches for deeper investigation

### Protocol

1. **START**: Run `cm context "<task>" --json` before non-trivial work
2. **WORK**: Reference rule IDs when following them (e.g., "Following b-8f3a2c, checking token expiry first...")
3. **FEEDBACK**: Leave inline comments when rules help/hurt:
   - `// [cass: helpful b-xyz] - reason`
   - `// [cass: harmful b-xyz] - reason`
4. **END**: Just finish your work. Learning happens automatically.

### What You Don't Need To Do

- Run `cm reflect` (automation handles this)
- Run `cm mark` for feedback (use inline comments instead)
- Manually add rules to the playbook
- Worry about the learning pipeline

### Quick Examples

```bash
# Before implementing auth
cm context "implement JWT authentication" --json

# When stuck on a bug
cm context "fix memory leak in connection pool" --json

# Checking for past solutions
cm context "optimize database queries" --json
```

### Inline Feedback Format

```typescript
// [cass: helpful b-8f3a2c] - token expiry check prevented auth rabbit hole
// [cass: harmful b-x7k9p1] - caching advice was wrong for our stateless arch
```
