  "accomplishments": [
    "Implemented new scoring algorithm with confidence decay",
    "Added comprehensive unit tests for decay calculations",
    "Refactored bullet schema to support feedback events",
    "Updated documentation with decay formula examples"

  "decisions": [
    "Used exponential decay formula: 0.5^(ageDays/halfLife)",
    "Set default half-life to 90 days for most rules",
    "Applied 4x multiplier for harmful feedback"
