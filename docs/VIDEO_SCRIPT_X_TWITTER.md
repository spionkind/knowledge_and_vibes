# Knowledge & Vibes — X/Twitter Video Script (60–90s)

## Version A (≈75–90s)

If you’ve ever “vibe‑coded” with AI—got a demo fast, then watched it collapse—here’s why:

Your idea contains thousands of decisions… and you compress it into one prompt.  
The AI fills the gaps with assumptions.  
Those assumptions become architecture.  
Bad architecture becomes a rewrite.

**Knowledge & Vibes** is an operating system for building software with AI.  
It’s not a framework like React. It’s a workflow.

The core principle is simple: **truth lives outside the model.**  
Not in confidence. In tests, builds, documentation, and measurable evidence.

It gives you a 10‑stage pipeline:
North Star → requirements → decisions → risks → plan pack → phases → tasks (“beads”) → execution → calibration → release.

And it enforces three rules that change everything:
tests first, three tries max then decompose, and a security scan before shipping.

If you’re AI‑savvy but not a professional developer, this is the missing layer: workflow that makes it hard to be wrong without noticing.

Start with `START_HERE.md`. Copy the North Star template. Build from there.

## Version B (≈45–60s, tighter)

AI coding projects fail because you compress a high‑definition idea into a short prompt, and the model fills gaps with assumptions.

**Knowledge & Vibes** fixes that with a workflow:  
make goals explicit, turn intent into testable requirements, break work into tasks, coordinate agents, and enforce verification.

Core principle: **truth lives outside the model**—tests, builds, docs, evidence.

Tests first. Three tries max. Security scan before you ship.

If you want to build with AI without the project collapsing, start with `START_HERE.md`.
