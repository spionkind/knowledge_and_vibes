# Decisions Template (ADRs)

ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) capture significant decisions so they don't get relitigated later.

The goal is to record what you decided, what the alternatives were, and what would make you change your mind.

## Agent Prompt

Use this when you need help making a decision:

```
I need to make a decision about:
[describe the decision]

Context:
[relevant constraints, requirements, or background]

North Star priority order:
[e.g., Safety > Correctness > UX > Speed]

Help me think through this:
1. What are 2-3 realistic options?
2. What are the tradeoffs of each?
3. Which option best fits my priorities?
4. What would make us reconsider this decision later?

If you need more information to give good options, ask me.
```
