### The fastest path to understanding and using Knowledge & Vibes

## What This Framework Enables

Knowledge & Vibes gives you a structured system for building software with AI:

| Challenge | How This Framework Addresses It |
|:----------|:--------------------------------|
| Keeping AI aligned with your goals | Explicit North Star cards anchor intent |
| Managing complex, multi-step projects | Beads track tasks with dependencies |
| Coordinating multiple agents | Agent Mail prevents conflicts |
| Catching issues before they compound | Verification gates and calibration checkpoints |
| Maintaining evidence that things work | TDD-first with mandatory test coverage |

> **The core insight:** Truth lives outside the model. Tests that pass, code that compiles, documentation that exists: these are truth. Everything else is hypothesis requiring verification.

---

## The Solution in 60 Seconds

0. **Discover thoroughly**: Surface every decision hiding in your idea before any agent touches code
1. **Plan explicitly**: North Star cards, requirements with acceptance criteria, recorded decisions
2. **Track everything**: Beads (tasks) with dependencies, status, verification requirements
3. **Coordinate agents**: File reservations, claim/close announcements, message routing
4. **Verify continuously**: Tests before code (TDD), security scans before commit, calibration between phases
5. **Bound iteration**: Max 3 repair attempts, then decompose or escalate

**The core principle:** Plan as much as appropriate. Give the AI as few decisions as possible.

**The result:** A repeatable process that produces working software.

## The Core Principles

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 0. Give AI Few Decisions

**Plan as much as appropriate. Give the AI as few decisions as possible.**

Any decision you don't claim, you implicitly delegate. Gaps become assumptions. Assumptions become architecture. Bad architecture becomes a rewrite.

**The plan is complete when there's nothing left to interpret.**

### 1. Truth Lives Outside the Model

AI output is not truth. Truth is:
- Tests that pass or fail
- Code that compiles or doesn't
- Documentation that exists or doesn't

Every claim must be verified, not trusted.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 2. Tests Adjudicate, Not Rhetoric

When agents disagree, write tests that distinguish the approaches. Run the tests. Let results decide.

Tests are the tiebreaker.

### 3. Decompose When Reality Demands It

Don't pre-plan everything. Start with coarse tasks (beads). Attempt execution. If it fails after 3 tries, *then* decompose. Only the failing part.

### 4. Minimal Viable Planning

A 200-line script doesn't need a 50-page plan. Match plan size to project complexity.

"Lossless" means no guessing required, not "exhaustively long."

## What a Session Looks Like

```bash
# Start session
/prime                      # Register, check inbox, discover tasks

# Claim work
/next-bead                  # Find task, reserve files, announce [CLAIMED]

# Implement (TDD-first)
pytest                      # Run tests (expect red)
# ... write implementation ...
pytest                      # Run tests (expect green)
ubs --staged                # Security scan (mandatory)

# Close work
git add -A && git commit
bd close <id> --reason "..."
# Agent releases files, sends [CLOSED]

# Between phases
/calibrate                  # Hard stop, check for drift
```
